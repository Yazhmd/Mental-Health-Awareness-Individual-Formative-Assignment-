## Project Outline

**Mindspace** is a mental health awareness website designed to provide users with educational resources, mindfulness tools, and community support. The platform aims to create a calming, user-friendly environment where individuals can access mental health content, track their wellness progress, and connect with others for support. With an emphasis on intuitive design, consistent navigation, and soothing aesthetics, Mindspace is built to help users manage stress and improve their mental well-being.

## User Experience (UX)

  

###  User Stories

As a first-time user, I want to quickly understand the websiteâ€™s purpose and navigate easily, so that I can find mental health resources without feeling overwhelmed.

As a returning user, I want consistent navigation and a familiar layout across all devices, so that I can easily access my preferred tools and resources without searching.

As a user struggling with anxiety and mental health problems, I want to find calming, supportive content like guided meditations and articles, so that I can feel more at ease and manage my stress better.





### Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  
 With Mindspace, the strategy was to create a digital environment that promotes mental well-being by focusing on empathy and user needs. We design with the understanding that mental health resources must be easy to access and navigate. Every design decision is geared toward reducing stress and improving user experience, allowing users to engage with content that supports their mental wellness journey.

  

### **2. Scope**  

The scope of Mindspace includes delivering functional tools and supportive content that aid mental health improvement. From mindfulness exercises to mental health tracking, our features are designed to meet users where they are in their journey. We aim to provide accessible and meaningful content, ensuring that all resources are clear, relevant, and easy to interact with, fostering a supportive online space. 

 

### **3. Structure**  

The structure at Mindspace is crafted to minimize overwhelm and simplify user journeys. We organize content and tools in a way that promotes ease of use and a sense of calm. Whether users are seeking educational articles, guided meditations, or community support, the logical structure and flow help them find what they need quickly, contributing to a positive mental health experience.





- Links are easily identifiable and clickable, with a consistent, layout across all pages, ensuring information is clear and accessible.

- Buttons and links provide visual feedback



- A navigation bar and footer are present on every page and device size, offering consistent information for a seamless, familiar experience that enhances user can be accustomed to.

  
### **4. Skeleton**  
The skeleton of Mindspace emphasizes intuitive design, where essential tools and resources are placed in easily accessible areas. By reducing clutter and providing clean, functional layouts, we ensure that users can focus on their mental well-being without unnecessary distractions, enhancing their overall interaction with the platform.





### **5. Surface**  

The surface design of Mindspace combines soothing aesthetics with functionality. Soft color palettes, minimalistic icons, and mindful typography are carefully chosen to create a calming environment. This design approach not only makes the platform visually appealing but also fosters a sense of peace, helping users feel supported and relaxed as they navigate the site.

## Design


### **Color Scheme**  

  Color plays a crucial role in website design, especially for a mental health awareness platform. The right colors can evoke emotions, set a calming tone, and create a sense of trust and comfort for users. Soft, soothing hues can reduce stress and promote relaxation, helping users feel more at ease as they navigate the site. Gradients, such as Star Wine, are a great choice because they blend rich, warm tones with softer shades, offering a visually appealing, harmonious look. This gradient not only adds depth to the design but also conveys warmth and reassurance, making it ideal for a space dedicated to mental health awareness.

### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'Roboto' and 'Lato'. I felt the clear, soft lettering suited the intended aesthetic and purpose of the website.  'Lato' was used for larger bodies of text and 'Roboto' was used for smaller bodies of text 
   

        
### **Imagery**  
  
The image I used was a stockphoto from istock for the jumbotron.  The image on **Mindspace** features an abstract human head made of dotted particles, representing the connection between technology and mental health. This visual reflects the role of digital tools in supporting mental well-being while symbolizing the complexity and clarity of mental health. By choosing this image, we aim to convey innovation and hope, inviting users to explore resources that enhance their wellness journey.
