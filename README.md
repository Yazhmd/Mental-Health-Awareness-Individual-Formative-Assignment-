## User Experience (UX)


### Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  


  

### **2. Scope**  

The SCOOPS site must be available on a wide range of devices due to the varied range of customer ages. A large portion of their client base is the retired, over-60 age group, comprising mostly of grandparents bringing their grandchildren out for a weekly treat. SCOOPS provides a comfortable, no-fuss, homely environment for its dine-in patrons and they wished for this to be reflected in the website.  

- The site is to contain only essential information, presented in a similar fashion and layout.   
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, location, and opening times.  
- A brief history of the business is to be included on the landing page.  
- For future development, an ordering system for party/catering requests will be included. Also, a large gallery page featuring images of the ice cream flavours, sundae specials, and candid shots of customers and staff.
  

### **3. Structure**  

Similar to the idea for the design and layout to be accessible and functional, simple navigation and interactivity were essential. The site needed to provide information swiftly no matter the age of the user.  
- Easy to identify, clickable links with a consistent layout. The design was to be predictable for each page with the information clearly identifiable.  
- Any buttons or links had to provide feedback to the user to identify their purpose in the form of a design change that followed the flow of the overall aesthetic.  
- A large, clear button to bring the user directly to the menu would be placed front and center of their eye-line.  
- In addition, a navigation bar and footer would be visible on every page, at every device size, displaying the same information. This would provide the returning customer with a faster route to their information destination, strengthening the site's familiar and trusting feeling.

## Design


### **Color Scheme**

### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'Josefin Sans' and 'Lato'. I felt the clear, soft lettering suited the intended aesthetic of the website. I had intentions to use Lato for my smaller bodies of text, however, I chose to stick with Josefin to keep the font consistent.

### **Imagery**  
  
The images that I have chosen for my site reflect the bright, retro aesthetic I am looking for. Close-ups of large displays of ice cream create a positive feeling for the user, prompting them to delve further into the menu section. A large image sits below the menu options, it shows the most popular dessert of a warm brownie with a scoop of delicious ice cream. The sites [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/), [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) and [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/) provided the royalty-free stock images used throughout the website, with attributions to each photographer placed in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.
